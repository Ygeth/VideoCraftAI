    </p><h1>Key Elements of an Effective Short AI Video Prompt</h1><p>
      For short AI-generated videos, a well-crafted prompt should include:
    </p><ol>
        <li>
      <p>
      <strong>A Clear Subject and Action</strong> – Keep it simple and focused
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Environmental Context</strong> – Define setting, atmosphere, and time of day
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Camera Perspective</strong> – Specify framing and angle (avoid complicated movements)
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Visual Style</strong> – Clarify aesthetic approach and lighting conditions
    </p>
    </li>
      </ol><h1>Structured Templates for AI Video Prompting</h1><h1>Cinematic Scene Structure</h1><pre>{Genre/setting}, {Main character/subject}, {Simple action}, {Environment details}, {Camera perspective}, {Lighting style}</pre><p>
      <strong>Example:</strong><br><em>A neon-lit cyberpunk city at midnight. A solitary figure stands atop a skyscraper, watching rain scatter the neon reflections below. Wide shot, slightly behind the figure. Cool-toned lighting with deep blue and purple hues enhancing the futuristic atmosphere.</em>
    </p><h1>Nature Scene Framework</h1><pre>{Location and time}, {Subject}, {Simple action}, {Environmental details}, {Camera perspective}, {Lighting}</pre><p>
      <strong>Example:</strong><br><em>A tropical beach at dawn. A sea turtle slowly emerges from the water onto golden sand. Low-angle shot capturing the turtle’s movement and the glowing pink-orange sunrise. Soft, directional morning light casting long shadows.</em>
    </p><h1>Product Showcase Setup</h1><pre>{Product}, {Setting}, {Simple presentation}, {Visual style}, {Camera focus}, {Lighting style}</pre><p>
      <strong>Example:</strong><br><em>A sleek espresso machine on a marble kitchen counter. Steam rises gently from a freshly brewed cup. Minimalist aesthetic with a clean, modern design. Close-up focusing on chrome details and swirling steam. Soft, diffused lighting highlights the product’s elegance.</em>
    </p><h1>Enhancing Your Prompts with Style Modifiers</h1><p>
      Since AI clips are short, selecting style elements that fit within these constraints enhances the final result.
    </p><h1>Visual Styles</h1><ul>
        <li>
      <p>
      <strong>Cinematic</strong>: Rich colors, film-like depth
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Photorealistic</strong>: Maximum realism and fine detail
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Stylized</strong>: Artistic, abstract, or exaggerated aesthetics
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Anime-style</strong>: Japanese animation influence
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>3D animation</strong>: CG-rendered elements with depth
    </p>
    </li>
      </ul><h1>Camera Perspectives (Simple and Effective)</h1><ul>
        <li>
      <p>
      <strong>Wide static shot</strong> – Capturing the full scene without movement
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Medium shot</strong> – Framing the subject from the waist up
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Close-up</strong> – Detailed focus on key elements
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Overhead view</strong> – Top-down perspective of the scene
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Low-angle shot</strong> – Looking up at the subject
    </p>
    </li>
      </ul><h1>Lighting Styles</h1><ul>
        <li>
      <p>
      <strong>Natural daylight</strong> – Realistic outdoor lighting
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Golden hour</strong> – Soft warm hues at sunrise or sunset
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Studio lighting</strong> – Controlled, professional illumination
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Dramatic contrast</strong> – High-contrast shadows and highlights
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Colored lighting</strong> – Enhancing mood with specific hues
    </p>
    </li>
      </ul><h1>Practical Examples Across Video Types</h1><h1>Character Animation</h1><p>
      <em>A 3D animated fox in a sunlit clearing. The fox tilts its head curiously, ears perked up. Vibrant, stylized cartoon aesthetic. Medium shot capturing its expressive face. Dappled sunlight filtering through tree branches enhances the scene.</em>
    </p><h1>Atmospheric Landscape</h1><p>
      <em>A misty mountain valley at sunrise. Low-hanging clouds drift between pine-covered peaks. A wide establishing shot captures the vastness of the scenery. Cool early morning tones contrast with golden sunlight hitting the mountaintops.</em>
    </p><h1>Fashion Showcase</h1><p>
      <em>A model in a flowing red dress poses in an art gallery. The dress subtly moves as if caught in a breeze. A high-fashion photography style with a balanced composition. Medium shot centering the model against minimalist white walls. Soft, diffused lighting highlights the dress's texture.</em>
    </p><h1>Advanced Tips for AI Video Prompting</h1><h1>1. Focused Action</h1><p>
      Since AI-generated videos are only a few seconds long, describe a single motion clearly: ✅ <em>"The golden ring slowly rotates under a spotlight, catching reflections..."</em><br>🚫 <em>"The ring spins, then transitions to a new angle before being placed on a hand..."</em>
    </p><h1>2. Technical Precision</h1><p>
      Use industry-standard film terminology for better AI interpretation: ✅ <em>"Extreme close-up with a shallow depth of field on the watch face"</em>
    </p><h1>3. Style References</h1><p>
      Mention visual inspirations for easier AI adaptation: ✅ <em>"Neon reflections on wet pavement, inspired by Blade Runner"</em>
    </p><h1>Mistakes to Avoid</h1><ol>
        <li>
      <p>
      <strong>Too Many Actions</strong> – Avoid multiple movements within a single clip
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Scene Transitions</strong> – AI generators struggle with cutting between scenes
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Overly Complex Camera Moves</strong> – Stick to simple angles and static shots
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Multiple Subjects with Independent Actions</strong> – Keep the focus on one clear subject
    </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Mismatched Styles</strong> – Avoid blending conflicting visual aesthetics
    </p>
    </li>
      </ol><p>
      Since short AI-generated clips are best for capturing a single impactful moment, focus on rich visuals instead of complex narratives.
